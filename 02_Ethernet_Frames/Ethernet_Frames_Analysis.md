# # Using Wireshark to Examine Ethernet Frames

# ## Objectives

# **Part 1:** Examine the Header Fields in an Ethernet II Frame

# **Part 2:** Use Wireshark to Capture and Analyze Ethernet Frames

# 

# ## Background

# When upper-layer protocols communicate, data flows down the OSI layers and is encapsulated into a Layer 2 frame.

# 

# For Ethernet LANs, encapsulation uses the \*\*Ethernet II\*\* frame format.

# 

# In this lab, I analyzed Ethernet II frames using Wireshark to understand:

# - Frame fields (destination, source, type, data, FCS)

# - ARP request/reply traffic

# - ICMP (ping) traffic between hosts

# - Differences between local and remote traffic

#

# 

# ## Required Resources

# - CyberOps Workstation VM

# - Mininet topology provided in the lab support files

# - Wireshark installed on the VM

# ## Part 1: Examine the Header Fields in an Ethernet II Frame

# 

# ### Step 1: Review Ethernet II Header Fields

# 

# | Field               | Length        | Description |

# |---------------------|---------------|-------------|

# | Preamble            | 8 bytes       | Synchronization bits (not shown in Wireshark) |

# | Destination Address | 6 bytes       | MAC address of the destination |

# | Source Address      | 6 bytes       | MAC address of the sender |

# | Frame Type          | 2 bytes       | Identifies the upper-layer protocol (e.g., 0x0800 = IPv4, 0x0806 = ARP) |

# | Data                | 46â€“1500 bytes | Encapsulated payload |

# | FCS                 | 4 bytes       | Frame Check Sequence (error detection, not shown in Wireshark) |

#

# 

# ### Step 2: Analyze an ARP Request in Wireshark

# Opened a capture of ARP and ICMP traffic between a PC and its default gateway.
