# Wireshark Log Analysis

This repositroy documents my practical work with Wireshark and supporting tools.
The goal of this project is to build a hands-on portfolio that demonstrates my ability to analyze network traffic, detect malicious activity, and apply security conecepts relevant to a SOC analyst role.

I believe it's important to show more than just certifications hence this project to demonstrate my practical skills in interpreting network traffic, identifying suspicious activity, using industry standard tools (Wireshark, SecOnion, tcodump, Splunk) and producing professional reports.

This repository is designed to be both a learning log and a portfolio project to share with recruiters and peers.

# Reflection
Throughout this lab, I practiced and documented the virtualization and lab setup of my work which required installing and configuring VirtualBox with CyberOps Workstation and Security Onion VMs.
I began to analyze and inspect Ethernet II frames (Layer 2), TCP 3-way handshake using Wireshark, a free and open-source network protocol analzyer. I used Wireshark to capture and analyze HTTP vs HTTPS traffic.

# Tools & Programs
Wireshark - For capturing and analyzing packets
tcpdump - CLI packet analysis
Security Onion - IDS/NSM platform with Sguil & NetworkMiner
VirtualBox - Virtual machine environment for labs
Linux - Lab environments
